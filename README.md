## About the Project

The IRCTC Redesign project reimagines the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website with a modern, train-themed aesthetic. The app focuses on:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified booking process with a clean, intuitive design.
- **Premium Look**: Light backgrounds (`bg-gray-50`), dark elements (`bg-blue-600`), and glassmorphism effects.
- **Advanced Animations**: Pure CSS animations (e.g., moving train) and Framer Motion for interactive elements.
- **Engaging Content**: Promotions, loyalty rewards, and travel class showcases to enhance user engagement.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon to demonstrate modern web development practices and design principles.
